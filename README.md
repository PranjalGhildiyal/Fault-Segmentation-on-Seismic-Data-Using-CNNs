# Fault-Segmentation-on-Seismic-Data-Using-CNNs
Mapping fault planes using seismic images is a crucial and time-consuming step in hydrocarbon prospecting.
Conventionally, this requires significant manual efforts that normally go through several iterations to optimize how the different fault planes connect with each other.​ 
Many techniques have been developed to automate this process, such as seismic coherence estimation, edge detection, and ant-tracking, to name a few. 
However, these techniques do not take advantage of the valuable experience accumulated by the interpreters. ​ 
Using CNNs, however, is a technique to automatically detect and map fault zones using 3D seismic images in a similar fashion to the way done by interpreters.​
